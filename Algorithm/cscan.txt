Input Parameters:
    Read max (maximum disk range), head (initial head position), and n (number of disk requests).
Divide Requests:
    Split disk requests into two groups:
    ueue1 for requests â‰¥ head.
    queue2 for requests < head.
Sort Requests:
    Sort queue1 in ascending order.
    Sort queue2 in ascending order.
Build the Access Sequence:
    Start the queue with the initial head.
    Append queue1 to queue.
    Append max (end of disk) to queue.
    Append 0 (start of disk) to queue.
    Append queue2 to queue.
Calculate Seek Time:
    Compute the total seek time by summing the absolute differences between consecutive positions in queue.
Output Results:
    Print the head movement sequence, total seek time, and average seek time.
