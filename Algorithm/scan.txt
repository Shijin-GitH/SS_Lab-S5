Start
Input Disk Parameters:
    Read the maximum disk range (max).
    Read the initial head position (head).
    Read the number of disk requests (n).
Input Disk Queue:
    Initialize two empty queues: queue1 (for requests greater than or equal to head) and queue2 (for requests less than head).
    For each disk request:
    If the request is greater than or equal to head, add it to queue1.
    If the request is less than head, add it to queue2.
Sort the Queues:
    Sort queue1 in ascending order (from smallest to largest).
    Sort queue2 in descending order (from largest to smallest).
Build the Final Queue:
    Create a final queue that starts with the head position.
    Append all elements of queue1 to queue.
    Append the max (end of disk) to queue.
    Append all elements of queue2 to queue.
Calculate Seek Time:
    Initialize seek as 0.
    For each pair of consecutive positions in queue, calculate the difference (seek time) and accumulate it into seek.
Output the Results:
    Print the sequence of head movements (disk access order).
    Print the total seek time.
    Calculate and print the average seek time.
